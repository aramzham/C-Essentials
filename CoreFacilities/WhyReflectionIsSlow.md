🐌 Reflection is slow. When using reflection, the names of types and their members are not known at compile time; you discover them at run time by using a string name to identify each type and member. This means that reflection is constantly performing string searches as the types in the System.Reflection namespace scan through an assembly’s metadata. Often, the string searches are case-insensitive comparisons, which can slow this down even more.

🐌🐌 Invoking a member by using reflection will also hurt performance. When using reflection to invoke a method, you must first package the arguments into an array; internally, reflection must unpack these on to the thread’s stack. Also, the CLR must check that the arguments are of the correct data type before invoking a method. Finally, the CLR ensures that the caller has the proper security permis- sion to access the member being invoked.
