Examples on how to use files in C# 6.0 System.IO

* [Watcher] (https://github.com/aramzham/Dealing-with-files/tree/master/Watcher) is little application that will examine all the changes on your desktop.
* [Folder Shield] (https://github.com/aramzham/Dealing-with-files/tree/master/Watcher/FolderShield) will protect your __special folders__ from any kind of annoying changes, like adding, changing, deleting or renaming any file.

Armenian to Translite is a useful program for armenians living abroad who don't know armenian letters but do know armenian language (diaspora-armenians :-)).

* [What does it do?] (https://github.com/aramzham/Dealing-with-files/blob/master/HandleFiles/Translator/ArmenianToTranslite.cs)

It simply takes a text in armenian and transforms it to transiletration text document. In this example will be using **.doc** files.
