We are creating a custom collection and implementing some necessary functionality like `Add`, `Remove`, `RemoveAt`, `IndexOf` and many more.
`MyList` will have 3 constructors:
```javascript
1. public MyList() : this(0)
2. public MyList(int length)
3. public MyList(ICollection<T> collection)
```
For more detailed description, please, take a look at the code.
