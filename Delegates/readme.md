# Delegates
Examples on delegates of C# 6.0

[Delegate testing] (https://github.com/aramzham/Delegates/tree/master/DelegateTesting/Test) consists of some test on C# delegates. In a small example will be illustrated a solution on ITVDN task.

The task is very trivial and asks to calculate the arithmetic average of returned value of an array of delegates (too many _"of"_s though :-)).
Also, there is a wee fault down in the solution. Can you find it? A "Bounty" will be your reward! :+1:
