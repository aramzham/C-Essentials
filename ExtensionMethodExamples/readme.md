Examples of using extension methods in C# 6.0

_Extension methods enable you to "add" methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type. Extension methods are a special kind of static method, but they are called as if they were instance methods on the extended type._

The most common extension methods are the **LINQ** standard query operators.

Extension methods are very powerful tools that will faciliate your work. They help you to add some fuctionality into existing classes and structures, meanwhile not touching their formation.
